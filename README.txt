A simple project made in Unreal Engine 4 for familiarizing myself with ue4.

In this project you will saw some materials I made with photoshop and bitmap2material,
and some little features I learn to do with C++ and blue print.

You can run (shift), you can change the color of the cube when you shoot them (their scale will change and the cube will disappear at a certain scale),
you can also spawn a "bomb" by pressing 1, it will explode and change the color of the cube near the bomb.

Simple work but I hope it will bring you an idea of my what abble to do in ue4.
